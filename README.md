**Why**

Changing the url involves copy-pasting process multiple times. Using this extension we can change the base url and create a new tab with one click. This extension is suppose to increase the efficiency of our developers and remove the copy-pasting process.

**How to Use**
- For using this extension, we need to provide two urls
    - Base 1 url - default this will point to "https://console.zenefits.com"
    - Base 2 url - default this will point to "https://console.zenefits.com"

If Base 1 url matches with the base url of current active tab, if we click on 'Create tab' button, we will have new tab with the same url of current active tab but with Base 2 url.
